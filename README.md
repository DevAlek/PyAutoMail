# What is Carrier Pigeon?

Carrier Pigeon is an automated, highly versatile and convenient SMTP-based application made in Python and Qt6.  
If you don't know what SMTP is, I'd recommend that you read the following articles that explains the definition of SMTP and how to set it up:

- What is SMTP: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-smtp/;
- How to set Gmail's SMTP: https://www.gmass.co/blog/gmail-smtp/;
- How to set Yahoo's SMTP: https://www.gmass.co/blog/yahoo-smtp-settings/;
- How to set Outlook's SMTP: https://www.gmass.co/blog/outlook-smtp/;
- How to set Protonmail's SMTP: https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/imap-smtp-and-pop3-setup/.

If you use a different email provider, search how to setup a SMTP and input the address and port in this format (`address.tld:port`) at the “Other service” field. Select “Other” in the “Email service” combo box too.

Also, depending on how does the SMTP settings of your email provider works, you may use an ***API token*** instead of your normal password.
