<h1> PyAutoMail </h1>
<p>PyAutoMail is a tool developed by DevAlek to extract information from a spreadsheet (.tsv file) and put it into an email template to be automatically sent to all emails found in the spreadsheet.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Commom error</h2>
<p>Sometimes the login will fail even with all the credentials being right. This happens because some email providers will block this application for security reasons. To solve this on <b>Gmail</b>, turn this on: <b>https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps</b>. But be careful! Because other unknown applications will be able to log in as well!</p>

<h2> How to use the features </h2>
<p>Here you will see how to use the features this tool can offer you.</p>
<h3>Word replacer</h3>
<p>The word replacer will take a keyword from the spreadsheet and put the value in the text instead of the keywords between curly brackets.<br> E.G: Hi, {name}! â†’ Hi, Jennifer!</p>
<h3>Check TSV DataSlots</h3>
<p>This option will show you how the program understood your spreadsheet. So, you can look for errors even before the sending!</p>
<h3>Check Replace</h3>
<p>This option will show you how the text will be sent to the first person on the list (topdown order).</p>
